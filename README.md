# cot-4500-Pro1
# This project contains a requirements.txt section, in which all of the necessary packages/libraries to run the code are mentioned.The code contained in cot-4500-Pro1/src/main/assignment_1.py contains the 4 algorithms that were mentioned in the assignment instructions (Approximation Algorithm,Bisection Method, Fixed-Point Iteration, and Newton-Raphson Method).The code provides general cases of the algorithms (with specific functions), allowing the user # to input values for tolerance, start point, initial estimate, etc., once the code is run.The code contained in cot-4500-Pro1/src/test/test_assignment_1.py contains specific test cases, with several cases of the tolerance, start points, initialestimates, etc. being predetermined. This allows me to make sure the code runs the way it's supposed to and provides proper output for several test cases.

# Use the git and clone commands in your Python terminal, followed by the url to my GitHub submission, to run my code.
